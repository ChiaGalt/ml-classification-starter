# ML Classification Starter – Iris Dataset 

This project is a small but complete example of a **supervised classification pipeline** in Python.

It shows:
- how to load and explore a dataset (**Iris**, from scikit-learn)
- how to train and compare different classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN)
- how to evaluate them (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- how to organize a clean ML project
